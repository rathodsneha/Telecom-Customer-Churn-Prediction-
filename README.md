Customer Churn Prediction – Telecom Industry

Project Overview
This project predicts which customers of a telecom company are likely to leave (“churn”). It uses machine learning in Python for prediction and SHAP for understanding model behavior. An interactive Power BI dashboard visualizes the insights. Finally, it offers practical business strategies to reduce churn.

Tools and Technologies
• Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, SHAP)
• Jupyter Notebook
• Power BI

Files and Structure
Customer_Churn_Analysis_Report.pdf — Final report explaining findings
Churn_Dashboard_Telecom.pbix — Power BI dashboard file
(Optional) Dashboard screenshot — to preview the dashboard
(Optional) Sample data or notebook, if you wish to include them

Project Workflow

Cleaned and prepared input data

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Built classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Applied SHAP for model explainability

Segmented customers into At Risk, Loyal, and Dormant groups

Created an interactive Power BI dashboard

Provided actionable business recommendations

Key Findings
• Month-to-month customers and users with shorter tenure are more likely to churn
• Higher monthly charges correlate with increased churn risk
• Contract type, tenure, and online services are the most important predictors

Business Recommendations
• Offer discounts or incentives to encourage annual contracts
• Improve fiber service quality to lower churn
• Re-engage dormant users with targeted offers
• Promote bundled services (e.g., online backup) to boost retention
• Send personalized offers to at-risk customers early
